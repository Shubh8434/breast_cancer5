## Breast Cancer
###Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that grows in or around the breast tissue, mainly in the milk ducts and glands. A tumor usually starts as a lump or calcium deposit that develops as a result of abnormal cell growth.
Itâ€™s important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant).
