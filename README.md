# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
## Breast Cancer
###Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that grows in or around the breast tissue, mainly in the milk ducts and glands. A tumor usually starts as a lump or calcium deposit that develops as a result of abnormal cell growth.
Itâ€™s important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant).

Malingnat-->0 && Benign-->1 for computation

## About Project
### Can We Predict that a person has whether a benign or malingnat tumor?
Answer is Yess!!! 
This is a project on predicting whether a person has a benign or malingnat tumor in breast_cancer_sklearn_dataset using Machine learning Algorithm.This project is tested over lot of ml models. Out of these models Logistic Regression performed very well giving an 91% Score. . To increase Accuracy of algotithm, I have done hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV modeule and get score of 94%.
